Welcome to my digital domain! With 2.5 years of hands-on experience as a software developer at Texas Instruments and my current role at Amazon, I continue to thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact. Backed by a Master's in Computer Science, I specialize in full-stack development and cloud computing—crafting scalable, high-performance solutions that power real-world systems.</p>
<p>
At Amazon, I work on Alexa, building content safety guardrails for large language models (LLMs). My role involves designing intelligent systems that ensure conversational AI remains safe, reliable, and aligned with user trust. This space at the frontier of AI safety demands technical depth, creativity, and a strong sense of responsibility—all of which I bring to every line of code.</p>
<p>
Throughout my career, I bring a relentless pursuit of excellence, navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape with a strategic blend of expertise and adaptability. Staying at the forefront of industry trends, my commitment to continuous learning ensures that everything I build is not just functional but forward-thinking.</p>
<p>
Beyond the bits and bytes, my global perspective is shaped by a passion for travel, capturing the essence of diverse cultures through the lens of a seasoned photographer. This same precision and creativity extend to my culinary pursuits, where I orchestrate flavors with the same attention to detail found in my code.</p>
<p>
If you're ready to embark on a journey where professionalism meets innovation, where every project is an opportunity for digital artistry, then let’s not just meet expectations but exceed them. Together, let’s sculpt the future of technology with a touch of brilliance and a dash of ingenuity.</p>
